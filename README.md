WORK-IN-PROGRESS

Use MPV to play media files via Dired.

The name of this package is a reference to a Greek musical instrument
from the island of Crete.  Though according to the Oracle of Delphi,
it is a cryptic message for future generations: "MPV Access Needs
Dired to Output User's Requested Audio".
